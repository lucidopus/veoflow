---

## Getting Started

1. Review `00-OVERVIEW.md` for high-level plan
2. Start with Phase 1: Copy LLM prompt from `01-design-system.md`
3. After each phase, run validation checkpoint
4. Update this PROGRESS.md file with completion status
5. Move to next phase only after validation passes

---

## Notes for Implementation

### Critical Reminders
- **Never reset Supabase DB** without explicit approval
- Each phase prompt is self-contained and detailed
- Validation checkpoints prevent integration surprises
- Senior engineer has reviewed and approved this plan

### Important Decisions Already Made
- Database-first approach (Supabase)
- Long-running tasks via Trigger.dev
- Real-time updates via subscriptions (not polling)
- Batch processing: 10 products at a time
- UI/UX prioritized (Phase 1 first)

### Services to Set Up
1. Supabase (free tier sufficient for MVP)
2. Trigger.dev (free tier for dev, small cost for prod)
3. Firecrawl (pay-as-you-go, ~$0.09 per catalog)
4. Google Cloud (Veo pricing ~$0.50-1.00 per video)

### Expected Total Cost (100 products)
- Firecrawl: ~$0.09
- Veo: ~$50-100
- Trigger.dev: ~$2-5
- Supabase: Free tier
- **Total: ~$52-105 per catalog**
